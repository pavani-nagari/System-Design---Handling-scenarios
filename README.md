# System-Design---Handling-scenarios  

As a **Full Stack Developer**, I often encounter real-world scenarios that require designing systems which are **scalable, reliable, secure, and cost-efficient**.  
This repository is a collection of common system design scenarios and their possible solutions, covering different aspects of software engineering.

## üîπ Example Scenarios  

### 1. Scalability  
Handling sudden spikes in traffic  
**Example:** An e-commerce site scaling up during **Black Friday sales**.  

### 2. High Availability & Fault Tolerance  
Ensuring uptime even when servers or data centers fail  
**Example:** **Netflix** staying online even if one AWS region goes down.  

### 3. Performance Optimization  
Reducing latency with indexing, CDNs, and async processing  
**Example:** **YouTube** loading videos faster using CDNs.  

### 4. Consistency vs Availability  
Trade-offs between strong consistency and eventual consistency  
**Example:** **WhatsApp** showing ‚Äúlast seen‚Äù with slight delay vs. **bank transactions** needing strict consistency.  

### 5. Data Growth  
Managing large datasets through partitioning, lifecycle policies, and storage optimization  
**Example:** **Instagram** storing billions of photos with sharding & cold storage for older media.  

### 6. Security & Reliability  
Protecting systems with rate limiting, encryption, and monitoring  
**Example:** **PayPal** preventing fraud with request throttling and real-time alerts.  

### 7. Cost Optimization  
Designing efficient architectures without overspending on infrastructure  
**Example:** **Startups** using serverless functions to cut costs on low-traffic APIs.  

### 8. Extensibility  
Building modular systems that adapt easily to evolving business requirements  
**Example:** **Slack** adding video calls on top of its existing chat system using microservices.  

### 9. Real-time Systems  
Supporting live updates with WebSockets, Pub/Sub, and event-driven designs  
**Example:** **Uber** updating driver and rider maps instantly.  

### 10. Disaster Recovery  
Backup strategies, multi-region failover, and resilience testing  
**Example:** **GitHub** restoring service quickly after an outage using backups and failover plans.
